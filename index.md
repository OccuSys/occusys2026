# Occupant-Centric Energy Systems (OccuSys)
## Modeling and Control Beyond Static Boundaries  
### ACM BuildSys 2026 · Banff, Canada

<div class="callout">
The energy transition presents unprecedented opportunities to rethink how we model, predict, and respond to occupant behavior. From personalized thermal comfort control and human-in-the-loop systems to data-driven behavior prediction and adaptive building automation, emerging technologies enable buildings to become truly occupant-centric.
</div>

## Why OccuSys?

These advances are critical for:

- Providing thermal, visual, and acoustic comfort while reducing energy waste  
- Enabling demand response and integration of renewable energy systems  
- Supporting grid flexibility through occupant-aware load management  
- Addressing equity in comfort provision across diverse populations  
- Enhancing resilience during extreme weather events and grid disruptions  

## Workshop vision

Despite significant progress in related fields—from reinforcement learning for building control to IoT-enabled automation—occupant behavior modeling remains fragmented between disciplines.

OccuSys aims to:

- Share frameworks, datasets, and best practices for occupant behavior research  
- Identify research gaps and future directions in occupant-centric systems  
- Foster collaboration between academic researchers and industry practitioners
